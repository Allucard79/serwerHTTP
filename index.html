        <p> "When the first signs appeared, I did nothing. I had shrugged the old tales off like they were so much fantasy, and Tristram - no, the world - has paid dearly for my arrogance. I have tried to make up for my failings. Leah and I have spent her lifetime scouring the world, collecting pieces of the Prophecy of the End Days. If I can decipher it, we will have the key to defeating the Lords of Hell."
